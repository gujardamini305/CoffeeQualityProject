⭐ **About the Project**  


This project uses the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) dataset to study the factors influencing coffee quality.  
I built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that answers questions like:  

- ⭐ Which sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.) matter most for quality?  
- ⭐ How do processing methods and origins affect Cup Points?  
- ⭐ What role do defects and quakers play in reducing scores?  
- ⭐ What are the **trends in Cup Points from 2017–2023**?  

---

⭐ **Key Insights**  
- **Washed processing method** leads to the highest Cup Points.  
- **Taiwan, Guatemala, and Colombia** are the top-performing origins.  
- **Defects and quakers** negatively affect overall scores.  
- Cup Points show a **downward trend from 2017 to 2023**, suggesting possible decline in coffee quality over recent years.

⭐ **Tools & Skills**  
- Power BI (Data Visualization, DAX, Data Modeling)  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
